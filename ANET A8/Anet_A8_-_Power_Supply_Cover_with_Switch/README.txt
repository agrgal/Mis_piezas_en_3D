# Summary

**If you print this thing and find it useful, please consider hitting that "Tip Designer"
button and help support more designs.**

Basic power supply cover with ANET name added. Feel free to modify as needed. Please post photos of any prints that you make.

Providing two versions. One for PSU's with holes on each side. Another for screwing into the ANET frame (you will need to drill this).

**NOTE:** The original Sketchup files are also included with this Thing as it appears there may be slight measurement difference with the power units.

# How I Designed This
